## 🛰️🖥️🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Matthew Tralka *(he/him/his)* 

Geospatial software engineer and remote senser at the [University of Maryland](https://geog.umd.edu/). Passionate about making data more equitable, accessible, and approachable.

Unfortunately (& ironically!), a lot of my work can't *yet* be made open-source. If you have a specific software-need that you think I can help with, please [contact](mailto:mtralka@umd.edu) me and I would be happy to help however I can.

### 🧰 Toolbox
- Python - dask, celery, cython, etc
- JavaScript / TypeScript - Vue 3, Nuxt, WindiCSS, Pinia, DeckGL, etc
- Docker Compose
- Postgres / PostGIS
- AWS - EB, S3, CF, RFS, R53, DDB, Lambda
- and anything else I need to get the job done
