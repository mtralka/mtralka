Geospatial software engineer at [Planet](https://www.planet.com/). Previously, research faculty at the [University of Maryland](https://geog.umd.edu/). Passionate about making data more equitable, accessible, and approachable.

Unfortunately (& ironically!), a lot of my work can't *yet* be made open-source. If you have a specific software-need that you think I can help with, please [contact](mailto:mtralka@umd.edu) me and I would be happy to help however I can.
